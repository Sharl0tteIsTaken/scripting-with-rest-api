🎯 **Goal**
Replace the character used for angle brackets within HTML `<pre>` tag in the {language} translation of `{file}` to properly display the error message.

🐞 **Problem**
The {language} translation [{chapter_name}]({chapter_link}) section, in the first code block in the collapsible section (**`{summary}`**), the last line uses the character `<` within an HTML `<pre>` tag, causing `<your-username>` to be treated as an HTML tag and therefore invisible.

💡 **What needs to be done**
Replace the angle brackets within HTML `<pre>` tag with [HTML character reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Character_reference). You can find the file to work on at the following URL:
{filepath}

🔧**What needs to be changed**
- Locate the line begin with: `fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/...'`
- Replace `<` with `&lt;` in this line
- Replace `>` with `&gt;` in this line
